# Computer Science A-Level Summer Work

This repo contains some of the C code I've played about with for my Comp Sci summer work.

## `main.c`

The `main.c` file asks a user to input their date of birth, one value at a time.

As the user enters their DOB, the program verifies that the entries are valid by checking that the year entered isn't in
the future, the entered month is valid, and the date matches the suitable range for the month. 

## `excersise1.c`

Using the pseudocode example below, write a program that asks the user for 2 float numbers, separated by commas and then
multiplies them, and outputs the answer.

```python
num1 = INPUT ("Enter number 1")
num2 = INPUT ("Enter number 2")
result = num1 * num2
OUTPUT result
```
