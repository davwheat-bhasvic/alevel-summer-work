# Computer Science A-Level Summer Work

This repo contains some of the C code I've played about with for my Comp Sci summer work.

The `main.c` file asks a user to input their date of birth, one value at a time.

As the user enters their DOB, the program verifies that the entries are valid by checking that the year entered isn't in
the future, the entered month is valid, and the date matches the suitable range for the month.
